"""SQLite-backed council board.

Every process in Agora -- the MCP server each agent CLI spawns for itself, the
supervisor, the human UI -- talks to one file through this module. There is no
server-of-record and no daemon requirement: if nothing else is running, the board
is still readable and writable, which is what lets a failed wake degrade to
catch-up-on-next-turn instead of deadlocking a topic.

Encoding: this runs on a machine whose console codepage is cp950 and whose
council will carry Chinese text from day one. Every text boundary in this project
is pinned to UTF-8 explicitly. Mojibake at a protocol boundary reads as protocol
corruption and costs a day to diagnose.
