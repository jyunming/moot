"""Spawn-per-turn adapters for the four CLIs.

All four are the same shape -- build argv, run to completion, let the agent post
through its own Agora MCP tools -- and differ only in flags. So they share a base
and contribute an `argv()` each, rather than being four hand-written subprocess
dances that drift apart.

## Session continuity is optional, and that is a feature

Claude, Codex and Copilot can resume a specific prior session by id. Gemini cannot:
its `--resume` takes `latest` or an index, not the UUID that `--session-id`
accepts, and "latest" races the moment one CLI holds seats on two topics.

The fix is not to fight it. **The board is the shared memory.** A stateless seat is
handed its catch-up excerpt in the prompt and reconstructs context from the record
every turn -- which cannot drift from what was actually said, unlike a long-lived
session. Continuity buys fewer input tokens, nothing else. `stateful=False` is a
supported mode, not a degraded one.

## Blast radius

v0 seats deliberate; they do not edit files. Each adapter therefore asks its CLI
for the narrowest tool surface it offers, and `--tool-policy` is where that per-CLI
decision lives so it is reviewable in one place instead of scattered through argv
builders. The flags differ in strength, and honestly: Claude's `--strict-mcp-config`
plus an allowlist is the tightest; Copilot's and Gemini's are weaker. `agora doctor`
verifies the restriction empirically rather than trusting that a flag did what its
name suggests.
