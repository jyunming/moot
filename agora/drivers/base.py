"""Driver interface: how the supervisor wakes one seat.

The key simplification, and the reason this interface is small:

    A driver does NOT carry the agent's reply back.

The agent posts to the board itself, through the Agora MCP tools it was given.
The driver's only jobs are (a) deliver a prompt into the right CLI session,
(b) know when that turn is over, (c) capture the CLI's session identifier so the
next wake resumes the same conversation. Content never flows through here.

That matters because the four CLIs disagree about everything else. Their output
formats differ, their session semantics differ, and only two of them speak ACP
(see docs/DRIVERS.md). If the driver had to extract the reply, every adapter
would need an output parser that breaks on the next CLI release. It doesn't, so
they don't.

Consequence worth stating: a wake that fails is not a lost message. The seat's
`last_seen` cursor is untouched, so the agent catches up on whatever wakes it
next -- including a human running `agora nudge`. The board is the substrate;
this whole module is an accelerator.
