"""A council in a Telegram chat — milestone C of docs/REMOTE.md.

The adapter itself is small, because the session is already two surfaces over
one dispatch: `Board(Console)` in the TUI swaps `emit` for a widget, and
`ChatBoard` below swaps it for a message. Everything a person can type in the
terminal works here the day the transport does.

What is *not* small is getting an agent's reply into a chat intact, and three
measured facts decide the design:

**HTML, not MarkdownV2.** MarkdownV2 requires escaping eighteen characters --
`_ * [ ] ( ) ~ ` > # + - = | { } . !` -- which includes the full stop, the
hyphen and the exclamation mark. Every sentence contains one, every bullet list
contains one, and an unescaped character does not degrade: Telegram rejects the
whole message. HTML mode escapes three (`<`, `>`, `&`) and supports `<b>`,
`<i>`, `<code>`, `<pre>` and `<blockquote>`. The failure surface is an order of
magnitude smaller.

**4096 characters per message.** A real reply on this project's own board ran
past 2000, and a concurrent three-seat round produces three at once. Splitting
happens on block boundaries, before rendering, so a chunk can never end inside a
tag.

**One message per second per chat, twenty per minute in a group.** A ten-round
council with three seats is thirty replies; posting them as they arrive hits the
group ceiling around round seven. The queue below is not an optimisation.

Nothing here can rule on a proposal yet. That arrives with the pairing checks,
not before them.
